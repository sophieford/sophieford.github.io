  <h2>Facebook's new Paper app is all polished minimalism and white space, but a grittier reading experience can be more satisfying</h2> <br>

  <div class="item text1 text2">
  <img src="assets/images/FBPAPER.jpg" alt="">
  </div>

  This week, Facebook launched Paper, an app designed to transform the experience of reading Facebook's content on your iPhone. It's uncluttered, slick, minimalist, polished. As one of the project's engineers put it: "Paper was designed on a principle: content should be respected … [and] if content is to be respected, it should be beautifully presented." <br> <br>

  You hear the word "beautiful" all the time, these days, when web design's being discussed. Medium, the blogging platform created by the Twitter co-founder Ev Wiliams, was conceived to be "simple [and] beautiful". Likewise Svbtle, another "beautiful" stripped-down publishing system, was designed to "get out of the way". This is the aesthetic of Jony Ive's iOS7, with its flat icons and defiant lack of adornment; it's an aesthetic for a world that does its reading on smooth pieces of black glass with curved corners. It's the aesthetic that's rapidly coming to dominate the web – which is why I feel some nervousness in poking my head above the parapet to say: what if I don't want my reading experience to be this beautiful? <br> <br>

  Yes, yes, of course this is partly just the ranting of a decreasingly young web user, disgruntled by change. But it isn't only that. There's some evidence to suggest that when you make the reading experience too smooth and glossy and beautiful, you make it less engaging and satisfying, too. The key concept here, explored in depth by the psychologist Adam Alter, author of the book Drunk Tank Pink, is "cognitive disfluency". When information glides by too frictionlessly, we're liable to find it harder both to understand and to retain. <br> <br>

  In a classic experiment, students were presented with a printed question: how many of each animal did Moses take into the ark? When the question was displayed in an easy-to-read typeface, 88% missed the error – that the gentleman in question was Noah, not Moses. When it was displayed in a hard-to-read font, that proportion fell to 53%. When a font's harder to read, writes Alter, "we assume the task is difficult and requires additional mental effort … We respond by recruiting additional mental resources to overcome that challenge, and our responses tend to be more accurate." Other studies have found that information received in unfamiliar fonts is memorised more effectively, and that it may be harder to grasp material consumed in e-book form, where the words slide by as if on ice skates, than in print.<br> <br>

  I'm not really suggesting that online publishers should deliberately employ awful fonts. But I doubt I'm alone in feeling a certain satisfaction when what I'm reading is presented in a non-beautiful way. It's hard to describe. But for some reason (linked to cognitive disfluency?) there's a greater sense of getting purchase on the material, of getting the meat of it between my teeth. <br> <br>

  I hope the people at the New York Review of Books won't take it wrongly when I say I consider their magazine to be Exhibit A in this regard. Every time I see that crazy jumble of fonts on the cover, then turn to the dense columns of type inside, I get a small but palpable thrill. All that density and lack of white space says: dive in; there's lots to get absorbed in here. <br> <br>

  By contrast, there's an unbearable lightness to the slippery minimalism of Medium, and sometimes it gets in the way. Writing presented like that is wonderfully easy to consume, yet also wonderfully easy to forget. By the time I get to the end of even a short piece, the first paragraph has faded not just from the screen, but from my mind. <br> <br>
  I don't expect the born-again minimalists of Silicon Valley to start re-cluttering their user interfaces. But it would be nice if they could remember that current aesthetic fashions are just current aesthetic fashions – not some ultimate Platonic ideal of how to communicate online. And if anyone wants to design a plug-in to make Medium look like the New York Review of Books, I can guarantee you one customer, at least.

  <h1>Aesthetics vs. Usability in Web Design</h1>
   <br>
   <p>

When it comes to your website, a site that’s easy to the eye will leave a positive, lasting impression. First impressions matter on the web where people make decisions in seconds on whether to stay or go!  And while it’s easy to get carried away with design extravagances that look cool, you must always keep usability in mind. Let’s take a closer look at aesthetics vs. usability in web design.<br> <br>

If you’re selling a product or service, a great looking website can help convert browsing visitors into paying customers. That is unless it gets overly complicated. Even if your website is an artistic masterpiece aesthetically, users will leave if they experience: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Hard to navigate web pages on mobile devices</li>
  <li>Non-intuitive layout</li>
  <li>Pages that are slow to load</li>
  <li>Dead links, too much scrolling, or other errors and bugs</li>
</ul> <br>

<h2>In UX Design, Functionality and Aesthetics Go Hand in Hand</h2>
One thing you mustn’t do is treat the aesthetics of your website separate from the functionality. The aesthetics of your web page involves its visual design and desired appeal. The usability is, of course, the features and functions.  Usability and aesthetics should be treated as equals. <br> <br>

<h2>Natural, Logical and Consistent — Three Important Characteristics</h2>
While your website’s code is written in seemingly unnatural languages, rendered and displayed by web browsers, your audience is human. Before a website is displayed for the public, it must be tested. It must be tested again after every modification. During the testing process, factors to check for are: <br>
<ul>
<li>Consistency; making sure each element correlates with each other.</li>

<li>Your website should have a “natural feel” to its layout. Avoid anything overly rigid or sharp contrasting edges.</li>

<li>A website’s layout should simply make sense. Each element, button, link or application should be in areas users would actually look for them.  Intuitive processes are key!</li>
</ul> <br>

<h2>Creating Immediate Interest Is Essential </h2>
There are a lot (over a billion!) websites available to the public. If users visit your website and have questions as to its purpose, it’s practically guaranteed they’re going to leave. Here’s a list of things that are likely to help first-time viewers convert into customers: <br>
<p><ul>
<li>Highly visible, high-resolution images related to your website’s core offerings.</li>
<li>Clear, appropriately sized, legible text.</li>
<li>A usable, well-organized layout that makes navigation intuitive and smooth.</li>
<li>Having a clear call to actions on display, such as showcasing a well-maintained store or catalog, or prompting them to register for a newsletter.</li>
<li>Offering a simple, but clear soft-lead-capture offer.</li>
</ul></p>

<br>
The most central reason for launching a website is to engage users into taking some sort of action. Web and UX design don’t only include factors such as color, shading or animations. Usability, mobile responsiveness, and purpose are equally as important. <br> <br>

If your website looks aesthetically pleasing and users are leaving about as quickly as they arrive, you’ll probably need to give its functionality a second review!

  <h1>Website aesthetics - <br> What has it got to do with usability?</h1>
   <br>
   <p>
When you choose an apple from a pile, what do you look for? You'll find a lot of reasons are aesthetic - whether it's shiny, it's colour, it's shape... <br><br>

How we choose what to buy is a key question that should be asked when designing an ecommerce website. While we all like to think we all make rational decisions, considering the functional nature of products, aesthetics clearly influences people and their choices. <br><br>
But why are we so easily influenced by aesthetics? <br><br></p>
<h2>How aesthetics influences us</h2>
<p> <br>
How a product looks certainly seems to influence our judgement - how many times have you bought a mobile phone that you liked the look of, only to realise upon using it for a few days that it didn't offer all the functions you wanted? <br><br>

There's been a lot of research demonstrating that aesthetics affects perceptions of a product and its usability. When asked to judge the usability and aesthetics scores of a series of ATM screens, 1 study found peoples' perceived usability scores were more closely related to the perceived aesthetics scores than the screens' actual usability. Further studies were able to replicate these results across cultures.<br><br>

The results imply people aren't able to distinguish usable and less usable objects, believing the aesthetically pleasing ones to be most usable.
<br><br>

But why does this interference occur? It's believed the main reason for this effect on peoples' judgements is what's known as a “halo effect”. This is where the aesthetic aspect of the design directly influences the perception of other aspects. For example the perception that a well fit suit or stylish dress makes the wearer seem smarter. <br><br>
</p>
<h2>How does usability come into this?</h2>
<p> <br>
Research has found that usability has a strong effect on people's judgements after using the object. But during the early stages of interaction with an object or system, aesthetics is clearly the major influence. This “halo effect” doesn't hold for long, if you wait 15 minutes to be served in a plush restaurant your opinion of the restaurant goes down, no matter how good the service afterwards. <br><br>
Usability becomes an important factor after a limited interaction with a product. A study found pleasure (closely related to aesthetics) and ergonomics (closely related to usability) both had a strong influence on the appeal of a product, but at differing levels at differing times. Appeal was strongly influenced by just aesthetics before use. But after use, both usability and aesthetics had an almost equal influence.<br><br> </p>
<h2>Aesthetics on the internet</h2>
<p> <br>
So, aesthetics influences us when looking at physical products, but does this influence carry over onto the internet? Of the two below, which site would you prefer to use? <br><br>

<div class="item text1 text2">
<img src="assets/images/1.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<div class="item text3">
<img src="assets/images/2.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<br><br>

List your reasons and aesthetics will once more be a factor. <br><br>
It's been found that aesthetics can be a deciding factor in whether a customer trusts a website enough to make a purchase. Another study found that people made “far reaching inferences about the qualities of online banking websites on the basis of simple screen shots, or very short interaction sequences.”<br><br>
Aesthetics will influence decisions anywhere people are given a choice.<br><br> </p>
<h2>What does all this mean?</h2>
<p> <br>
It means you need to integrate your aesthetic design more closely with usability.<br><br>
People appear to use aesthetics to judge appeal and perceived usability. So should you ignore usability and focus on aesthetics? Of course not. This “halo effect” appears to fade after initial use.<br><br>
The research studies highlighted show the power aesthetics can have, but design on its own doesn't make a complete site. A product's design can ensure the initial attraction but only usability and aesthetics working in combination will ensure consumers will keep using it.<br><br>
In many site redesign/construction processes the website aesthetic or user research is completed before the other is started. There is no interaction between the creative and user experience teams. This doesn't lead to integrated processes. How can a designer know what restrictions they are working with until user research has been conducted? At the same time, how can you ensure that the most relevant user research findings are integrated into a design without a dogmatic insistence that all guidelines are followed?<br><br>
There needs to be a closer working relationship between design and user experience. Aesthetics and usability support each other and when they work together they can be the difference between a good website and a first-rate one.

  <h1>The Importance of aesthetics in <br> Web-Design</h1>
   <br>
   <p>

A lot of rookie entrepreneurs – or even some who have been in business a long time – have a misconception about web design. As a business owner, a common mistake is designing a site that YOU like, rather than thinking about the end user, which are your prospects and customers. Looking cool and suiting your purpose are two completely different mindsets, but they can be merged together. For starters, just take a look at the aesthetics of your web design from an outsider’s perspective, rather than from the point of view of where you are now, as the business owner. <br><br>

First of all, yes visual appeal is important. But that’s not the highest priority and you must consider that everyone has different tastes, preferences and likes. It’s kind of like art. Some people like dark and mysterious, while others prefer colorful and lively, and yet another crowd may prefer the abstract or strange. Unless you’re selling artwork on your website, then many of these typical rules should fall further down the scale of priorities. <br><br>

With that said, here are the main components of an aesthetically (and strategically) appealing website: <br><br>

<h2>Flow</h2> In tekkie terms, this is the navigation of your website. It shouldn’t jump all over the place and have too many boxes or confusion. It should be simple, straightforward and easy for customers to find things they want to look at. The links should be driven to pages that pull them to take action. It should make sense.<br><br>
<h2>Branding</h2> Your website should reflect your brand, with an easy-to-identify corporate logo and colors that make your customers feel warm. It should put off a good vibe and reflect the personality of your company.<br><br>
<h2>Colors</h2> Don’t go for shock factor. Electric lime green might get their attention indeed, but the goal is not to make your customers scared. Color choices should again, give off a good aura and put your customers in the mood to buy. The colors reflect the energy of your website. White never goes out of style!<br><br>
<h2>Images</h2> Stock images might be easy, but people will definitely know if you have that stereotypical boardroom photo of six perfect looking people in business suits and ties smiling and ready to charge their credit cards. Or palm trees and sunsets at your corporate office, when you live in an area that has pine trees and snow. Instead, opt for custom photos of REAL people who work at your company, preferably doing REAL tasks or showcasing REAL products that you sell. Canned images are corny and consumers dislike them in general.<br><br>
<h2>Balance</h2> This is about the content and the balance of your web pages. If you have a consistency on each page, it will look more professional than having one page that has a couple of sentences and then another that you have to scroll down to read ten paragraphs. In general, it is best to have one captivating headline, a couple of paragraphs, followed by a few bullet points (for the skimmers) and then a conclusion and call-to-action. Keeping the balance in check also includes the images. Don’t overload your website with too many pictures or too few.<br><br>
<h2>Communication</h2> Does your message send the right signals? Make sure you speak consistently throughout the site and within the content. Don’t forget to answer the readers’ questions, even though you already know the answers you should keep in mind that your customers may not. Be clear or you will spend more time answering questions and inquiries from people who do not understand your message. Or, they might just go to another website (your competitor) that communicates better.<br><br>
<h2>Social media integration</h2> These days, you need to have your blog, “Like us on Facebook” and all other social media opportunities clearly displayed on your website. This way they can subscribe to your newsletter and stay in touch with you.<br><br>
<h2>Flexibility</h2> Be a little different. Being unique sets your business apart, so although you should apply the strategies outlined above, your website must still look exceptionally brilliant as compared to your competitors.
<br><br>
To sum it up, the aesthetics of your website is one of the most critical aspects for you to consider, so whether you’re building a new one from scratch or revamping an existing site, it’s best to choose a professional like 5StonesMedia.com. They know exactly how to create a site that suits your needs, target audience and that you will love from beginning to end.
